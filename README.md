rscala: Bridge Between 'R' and 'Scala' with Callbacks
===================================================================

By David B. Dahl, Brigham Young University
------------------------------------------

The rscala package provides a bridge between R and Scala, enabling a user to
exploit each language's respective strengths in a single project. The rscala
package brings Scala and Java libraries into R with a simple interface.
Specifically, Scala classes can be instantiated and methods of Scala classes
can be called directly. Furthermore, arbitrary Scala code can be executed on
the fly from within R and callbacks to R are supported.  The rscala package is
available on CRAN and requires no special installations or configurations of R
or Scala. 

Install the package in R by executing:

```R
install.packages("rscala") 
```
