serialize partitions

what if Java is not installed and I install a package like sdols?
Support stop?     (with exception)
Support warning?  (with cat)
a <- b <- 2       (Cannot do!)
scalaType("D0") inside a Scala transcompiled function should work!
bell.version1b gives different results than native R!
