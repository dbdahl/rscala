1.0.11 (2016-05-12)
  * Fixed broken URL.
  * Ship R code in JARs so that rscala does not need to be installed when
    embedding R in Scala.  Add the following to your build.sbt file:
    libraryDependencies += "org.ddahl" % "rscala_2.11" % "1.0.11"

  * Fixed display of README file if no Scala installation is found.

1.0.8 (2015-12-09)
  * Put CRAN URL in canonical form.

1.0.7 (2015-12-09)
  * On Windows, fix problem embedding R within a JVM application.
  * Fixed typographical error in documentation regarding 'strintrplt' function.
  * Fixed bug causing warning 'closing unused connection ...'
  * On Windows, also look at "...Wow6432Node..." registry key.

1.0.6 (2015-05-15)
  * Removed unnecessary 'Suggests' and 'VignetteBuilder'

1.0.5 (2015-05-15)
  * Added README.html to point to paper submitted to Journal of Stastical Software.
  * 'scalaInfo' function is much improved and 'scalaInstall' function is new.
  * Support of arbitrary R objects to be passed as an 'RObject' in Scala.
  * Improved exception handling.
  * Improved support for directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating
    an object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Check that JAR and package version match in JVM-based languages.
  * Added scaladoc for 'RClient' and 'RObject'.
  * Added javadoc for 'RClient'.
  * Documentation clarifications.
  * Minor bug fixes.

1.0.4 (2015-03-24)
  * Modified 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to conform to CRAN
    policies.
  * Support for subassignment into vectors and lists in RClient.
  * Bug fixes to respect 'java.opts' and 'java.heap.maximum' arguments.

1.0.3 (2015-03-23)
  * Added support to directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating an
    object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Added function 'scalap' to show the names and signatures of class and
    companion objects.
  * Added methods 'evalD0', 'evalD1', etc. and removed '%~%' method in RClient.
  * Use 'as.reference=NA' in 'intpGet' and friends so that 'as.reference=FALSE'
    is tried first and, if conversion is not possible, 'as.reference=TRUE' is
    done.
  * Added 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to facilitate other
    packages depending on the 'rscala' package.
  * Determine Scala version using Java executable (as located by 'javaCmd'
    function) instead of Scala executable.
  * Added infrastructure to support alternative interpreters in the future.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.

1.0.2 (2015-03-07)
  * On Windows, if all else fails, try to find the Java installation using the
    Windows registry.
  * Facilitate other packages depending on 'rscala' by explicitly importing
    'util' package needed for 'download.file' function.

1.0.1 (2015-03-05)
  * Initial release to CRAN.

1.0.0 (2015-03-03)
