3.2.0 (2018-10-04)
  * Automatic detection of available RAM and set the Java heap maximum to a
    reasonable default to avoid 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError'.  Users can still
    explicitly set it using the argument 'heap.maximum' of the function
    'scala' or through the function 'scalaMemory'.
  * Support for downloading and installing Java, Scala, and SBT within R
    (instead of having the user download, and install a compatible version).
  * Function 'scalaConfig' replaces functions 'scalaInfo' and 'scalaInstall'.
  * Function 'scalaMemory' replaces functions 'scalaHeapMaximum'.
  * Function 'scalaJARs' replaces 'scalaAddJAR'.
  * Added functions 'is.scalaReference', 'scalaFindBridge', 'scalaLazy',
    'scalaSBT', 'scalaVersionJARs'.
  * To aid in transferring rich objects between R and Scala, added functions
    'scalaPush', 'scalaPull', 'scalaPushRegister' and 'scalaPullRegister'.
  * Support named arguments in transcompiled functions.
  * Removed unnecessary functions 'scalaPackage' and 'scalaPackageUnload'.
  * Added function 'scalaDisconnect' to temporarily disconnect sockets between
    R and Scala.  Sockets are automatically re-established as needed.
  * Support for upcoming release of Scala 2.13.
  * Avoid Window's firewall pop up window.
  * Detection of trying to use a bridge across R instances and more helpful
    error message.
  * Bug fix regarding callbacks and lexical scoping.

3.1.0 (2018-07-12)
  * Preliminary support for transcompiling a (subset of) R code to Scala code.
  * Support for passing arbitrary R objects between R and Scala.
  * Bug fix: Close dangling connection on error from scalaInfo function.

3.0.2 (2018-06-29)
  * Improvements to the API.  See descriptions and examples in the help files.
  * Significantly reduced the overhead of making a calls to and from Scala,
    from milliseconds to hundreds of microseconds.
  * Operator cleanup
      * The `+` operator replaces the `%@%` operator.
      * The `*` operator replaces the `%~%` and `%!%` operators and subsequent
        evaluations skip the compilation step.  The `*` operator is not subject
        to Scala REPL's memory leak bug.  Within a function, arguments are not
        automatically passed.
      * The `^` operator replaces the `%.~%` and `%.!%` operators and is
        equivalent to the `*` operator, except it always returns an rscala
        reference.
  * Arguments are now passed to a Scala snippet by calling the bridge function
    and using the new `*` and `^` operators, e.g.
    s(x=3, y=rnorm(5)) * 'y.map(_+x)'.
  * Overall cleanup of interface.
      * New way to instantiate a class, e.g., name <- s $ .new_String('Alis')
      * New way to get a null reference, e.g., myNull <- s $ .null_String()
      * New way to cast, e.g., name $ '.asInstanceOf[Object]'()
  * Automatic detection of physical RAM and set the Java heap maximum to a
    reasonable default to avoid 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError'.  Users can still
    explicitly set it using the argument 'heap.maximum' of the functions
    'scala' or 'scalaHeapMaximum'.

2.5.3 (2018-04-10)
  * Resubmitted as per CRAN request.

2.5.2 (2018-04-07)
  * Added support for Java 9, 10, and 11.
  * Removed 'timeout' argument to 'scala' function.

2.5.1 (2018-02-10)
  * Added the .rscalaOptions function to make it easier to set
    rscala.scala.home, rscala.heap.maximum, rscala.command.line.options.
  * Added 'digest' as a suggested package for building the vignette.
  * Bug fix for rscalaRequire function on Windows.

2.5.0 (2017-11-24)
  * Made 'scala' function return NULL and provide the interpreter as a side
    effect.  This lowers the perceived delay in instantiating and first-use of
    a Scala interpreter.  Added 'scala2' and 'scala3' functions to customize
    how the Scala/R bridge is established.  Users should change instances of
    's <- scala()' to 'scala()' or 's <- scala3()'.
  * Caching of methods calls from difference instances of Scala references for
    faster invocation.
  * Added ability to control which variables are passed to a Scala
    function using the [ operator.  Including additional items can be
    convenient and excluding items avoids potentially costly serializing over
    the R/Scala bridge.  See the vignette for syntactical details.
  * Added experimental support for data frames with the scalaConvert.data.frame
    function.
  * Dropped support for Scala 2.10.x and Java 6.

2.4.0 (2017-09-27)
  * Improved input/output performance for large transfers over TCP/IP bridge.
  * Substantially lower protocol overhead when calling Scala methods (e.g.,
    's$scala.util.Random$nextGaussian()') and Scala
    functions (e.g., function(x) s %!% '2+x').
  * Scala functions no longer require default arguments and type signatures are
    now inferred by argument values (instead of being inferred from the default
    arguments).
  * Fixed broken temperature web app in vignette by replacing defunct
    'weatherData' package with 'darksky' package.

2.3.5 (2017-08-30)
  * Quote 'Scala' and 'R' in title and description as per CRAN request.

2.3.4 (2017-08-29)
  * Fixed issue with vignette building on Windows.

2.3.3 (2017-08-28)
  * Make vignette robust to missing microbenchmark package.
  * Make vignette avoid Scala's compiler daemon.

2.3.2 (2017-08-25)
  * Bug fix for depending packages on some platforms.
  * Tweeks to vignette build process to make it more robust.

2.3.1 (2017-08-21)
  * Version associated with resubmission of paper to Journal of Statistical
    Software.
  * If a requested version of Scala does not exits, offer to install it if
    R is interactive.
  * By default, set serialize.output to TRUE on Windows and FALSE otherwise
    so that Windows users also see stack traces and output be default.
  * Added rudimentary support for tab completion for methods on Scala
    references.
  * RClient is now thread safe.
  * RClient has a 'ping' method to check the vitality of the connection.
  * No longer export 'scalap' function which can be problematic.
  * No longer export the 'scalaOptimize' function.
  * Added the private method 'rscala:::latest()' to install the latest
    development build from my website.
  * ref$type returns the Scala type of a Scala reference 'ref'.
  * Added s$var(x) to get the value of an R reference 'x'.
  * Bumped default Scala version to 2.12.3.

2.3.0 (2017-08-08)
  * Never released.

2.2.2 (2017-05-24)
  * Improved behavior for packages that depend on rscala, including adding
    the .rscalaPackageUnload function to spin down the instance of
    the Scala interpreter/compiler started by the .rscalaPackage function.
  * Moved example to \donttest instead of \dontrun.

2.2.1 (2017-05-24)
  * Never released.

2.2.0 (2017-05-23)
  * Vectors of length one are treated as scalar unless wrapped by the I()
    function.  This new behavior is opposite of the previous behavior but
    consistent with the jsonlite and RJSONIO packages.
  * Added 'classpath.packages' argument to 'scala' function for easily using
    JARs for other packages.
  * Added 'rscala.scala.home' global option to provide another means to find
    the Scala home directory.
  * s$val(), s$.val(), and s$do() are reinstated (but not recommended unless
    you need the arguments to be variables instead of string literals).
  * Fixed bug by wrapping command.line.arguments by the shQuote function.

2.1.1 (2017-05-11)
  * Added functionality for depending packages to use Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x, or
    2.12.x (rather than what version the developer is using).

2.1.0 (2017-05-08)
  * Scala function defined in R can now use the %!% and %.!% operators.  See
    examples.  The alternative s$def() mechanism is deprecated and will be
    removed.
  * Overhead in Scala functions can be reduced with the scalaOptimize
    function.
  * s$null() is deprecated in favor of the scalaNull function.
  * s$val() and s$.val() are deprecated in favor of quoted strings, if needed.
    For example, instead of s$val("_Foo"), use s$"_Foo".
  * For package developers depending on rscala, the embedded interpreter is
    now only initialized on first use.
  * For package developers depending on rscala, the .rscalaDelayed function is
    deprecated and will be removed.  Instead, use the snippet argument of the
    .rscalaPackage function.
  * Added support for installing more than just the most recent version of
    Scala.
  * When attempting to find a suitable Scala installation, look for more than
    just the most recent version in the "~/.rscala" directory.
  * Internal reduction of duplicate code.

2.0.1 (2017-04-27)
  * Added URL to Scala web page in DESCRIPTION as requested by CRAN.

2.0.0 (2017-04-27)
  * Scala functions defined in R using the s$def() mechanism now specify the
    arguments using R code instead of a string snippet of Scala code.  Protocol
    overhead is reduced.  Function definition is accessible.  Caching avoids
    recompiling the same function for a big speed boost.
  * The s$do() mechanism is deprecated in favor of a simpler syntax.  For
    example, instead of s$do("scala.util.Random")$nextDouble(), use
    s$.scala.util.Random$nextDouble().
  * Scalars are now supported using the more flexible I() function and the
    "length.one.as.vector" option is removed.
  * The scalaEval, scalaGet, and scalaSet functions are removed in favor of the
    %~%, %.~%, %@%, and $ operators.
  * Support for matrices in either row-major or column-major order.
  * Support for byte/raw type.
  * Automatic garbage collection of Scala and R references.
  * RClient now provides invoke methods to simplify calling R functions from
    Scala and the scalaCallback function is removed.
  * Callbacks to the original R interpreter now properly perform lexical
    scoping as an R user would expect.
  * Option to set the port numbers for the TCP/IP sockets.
  * Fixed problem that the protocol.R may be inadvertently excluded from the
    JAR.
  * Other bug fixes, documentation improvements, behind-the-scenes
    optimization, and simplifications.
  * Bumped default Scala version to 2.12.2.

1.0.15 (2017-02-07)
  * Fixed line ending bug when embedding R in Java/Scala on Windows.
  * Bumped default Scala version to 2.12.1.

1.0.14 (2016-11-21)
  * Reinstated support for Scala 2.10 & 2.12.  Supported versions are now
    2.10.x, 2.11.x, and 2.12.x.
  * Renamed functions: 1. scalaInterpreter --> scala, 2. rscalaJar -->
   .rscalaJar, 3. rscalaPackage --> .rscalaPackage
  * Renamed 'intp*' functions to 'scala*' functions, e.g., 'intpSettings'
    became 'scalaSettings'.
  * Improved ability to find R on Windows using registry keys.
  * Added 'scalaCallback' function to wrap an R function for evaluation by
    Scala.
  * Improved input/output handling, adding the options serialize, stdout, and
    stderr options to the 'scala' function.
  * Removed 'intpLoad' function since '.rscalaPackage' provides this
    functionality.
  * Interrupts in R now close the connection rather than leaving it in an
    out-of-sync state.
  * Guard elements of the scala interpreter from access by the user through the
    '$' operator.
  * Fixed bug in return as noted by Duncan Murdoch.

1.0.13 (2016-07-07)
  * Added %@% operator for shorthand notation (e.g, "interpreter %@% snippet")
    to conveniently evaluate an expression without the overhead involved in
    returning a result.
  * Added serialize option to scalaInterpreter and intpSettings functions in R
    to control the capturing of console output.  Likewise, added
    serializeOutput field to the RClient class.  Avoiding serialization is
    faster and leads to a better experience.  Dropped the now-redundant quiet
    option.
  * Added support for 'unlimited' nested callbacks when Scala is embedded in R,
    where in practice the amount of nesting is only about a dozen if
    serialize=TRUE (because R runs of out sink resources) but is hundreds of
    levels if serialize=FALSE.
  * Restructured the package hierarchy, most notably moving RClient to
    'org.ddahl.rscala' instead of 'org.ddahl.rscala.callback'.
  * Dropped support for Scala 2.10.
  * Avoid the need to modify the original source of scala.Console object and
    the need to hijack the boot classpath.  The package now uses the standard
    'scala' executable from the Scala binary distribution, without any modified
    code and ugly hacks.

1.0.12 (2016-06-03)
  * Fast instantiation of RClient class (which was slow in 1.0.11).

1.0.11 (2016-05-12)
  * Fixed broken URL.
  * Ship R code in JARs so that rscala does not need to be installed when
    embedding R in Scala.  Add the following to your build.sbt file:
    libraryDependencies += "org.ddahl" % "rscala_2.11" % "1.0.11"

1.0.10 (2016-05-11)
  * Uploaded JARs to http://central.sonatype.org/
  * Make sure that rscala package is installed when trying to embed R in Scala.
  * Better error messages regarding compatible jars.

1.0.9 (2016-03-11)
  * Bumped support to latest Scala releases (2.11.8 and 2.10.6).
  * Fixed display of README file if no Scala installation is found.

1.0.8 (2015-12-09)
  * Put CRAN URL in canonical form.

1.0.7 (2015-12-09)
  * On Windows, fix problem embedding R within a JVM application.
  * Fixed typographical error in documentation regarding 'strintrplt' function.
  * Fixed bug causing warning 'closing unused connection ...'
  * On Windows, also look at "...Wow6432Node..." registry key.

1.0.6 (2015-05-15)
  * Removed unnecessary 'Suggests' and 'VignetteBuilder'

1.0.5 (2015-05-15)
  * Added README.html to point to paper submitted to Journal of Statistical
    Software.
  * 'scalaInfo' function is much improved and 'scalaInstall' function is new.
  * Support of arbitrary R objects to be passed as an 'RObject' in Scala.
  * Improved exception handling.
  * Improved support for directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating
    an object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Check that JAR and package version match in JVM-based languages.
  * Added scaladoc for 'RClient' and 'RObject'.
  * Added javadoc for 'RClient'.
  * Documentation clarifications.
  * Minor bug fixes.

1.0.4 (2015-03-24)
  * Modified 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to conform to CRAN
    policies.
  * Support for subassignment into vectors and lists in RClient.
  * Bug fixes to respect 'java.opts' and 'java.heap.maximum' arguments.

1.0.3 (2015-03-23)
  * Added support to directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating an
    object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Added function 'scalap' to show the names and signatures of class and
    companion objects.
  * Added methods 'evalD0', 'evalD1', etc. and removed '%~%' method in RClient.
  * Use 'as.reference=NA' in 'intpGet' and friends so that 'as.reference=FALSE'
    is tried first and, if conversion is not possible, 'as.reference=TRUE' is
    done.
  * Added 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to facilitate other
    packages depending on the 'rscala' package.
  * Determine Scala version using Java executable (as located by 'javaCmd'
    function) instead of Scala executable.
  * Added infrastructure to support alternative interpreters in the future.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.

1.0.2 (2015-03-07)
  * On Windows, if all else fails, try to find the Java installation using the
    Windows registry.
  * Facilitate other packages depending on 'rscala' by explicitly importing
    'util' package needed for 'download.file' function.

1.0.1 (2015-03-05)
  * Initial release to CRAN.

1.0.0 (2015-03-03)
  * Release to beta testers.
