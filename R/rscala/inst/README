Scala is not distributed with the rscala package.  Various techniques are used
to find a suitable Scala installation.  Details on the search are available
using "rscala::scalaInfo()".  Note that Scala itself requires Java.

Users can install Scala with "rscala::scalaInstall()", which places Scala in
the user's home directory under "~/.rscala".  Or, your operating system may
package Scala in its software repositories.  Or, a conventional Scala
installation can be performed: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html.
