Scala is not distributed with the rscala package.  Various techniques are used
to find a suitable Scala installation.  Details on the search are available
using "rscala::scalaInfo(verbose=TRUE)".  Note that Scala itself requires Java.

Users can install Scala with "rscala::scalaInstall()", which places Scala in
the user's home directory under "~/.rscala".  System administrators can use
"rscala::scalaInstall(global=TRUE)", which places Scala in the package's
directory but requires a new installation every time the package is updated.
To avoid this, a conventional Scala installation can be performed as described
here: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html.
